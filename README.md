# Die Monospace Web

This is remix of [Oskar Wickstr√∂m's Monospace Web CSS](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/). His code 
[is on Github](https://github.com/owickstrom/the-monospace-web), and I found a couple of improvements I can make.

1. Use a different reset.css, I think there are more recent CSS compliant ones.
2. Give an easy example of using it.
